# Backend Instructions

When interacting with the database, do not write any code directly in the `sqlitedb` folder. Do not write any Go code that directly executes SQL. Instead, write all queries in the `sql/queries` folder using plain SQL queries. I will then use sqlc to covnert that to Go code in `sqlitedb`. Once that code is generated, we can then hook it up to our domain types using the code in the `sqlitedatastore` folder.
